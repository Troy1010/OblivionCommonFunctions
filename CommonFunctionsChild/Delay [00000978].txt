scn Delay

;This function will only advance its timer during GameMode. Use Delay2 for more options.

float fSecsToWait ;fSecsToWait. (Negative values are considered FramesToWait)(-1 will execute at the start of the next frame)
ref rHandlerFunction ;rHandlerFunction. Expected to accept an array_var argument. If SetFunctionValue is not 0, the handler will execute every frame until it is.
array_var aVariablesToPass

;*Currently, using -1 for fTimeToWait is the same as using 0.
; I was thinking about adding the functionality that if 0 is used as fTimeToWait, the rScriptToRun runs during the same frame, just at the end of it.
; However, at this time, I cannot think of a real use for that functionality, nor a solid way to implement it.
