scn IsCallingObjectStable

;When a script is called by an UnstableObject, most GetProperty functions (not including GetBaseObject) return null.
;Calling GetSelf from an unstable object will cause CTD.
;This generally only happens for:
;	A script attached to an object during the frame it is being added/deleted.
;	A script attached to an actor during the frame it is being created.
;*during those frames, the script runs twice - Once unstable, and again stable.

begin _Function { }
;A shortcut. Most calling objects will have an attached script, and rUnstableObject.GetScript returns 0 without causing CTD.
if eval GetScript
	SetFunctionValue 1
	return
;Another shortcut.
elseif eval 255 != GetSourceModIndex GetBaseObject

	return
;"00000000" represents a failure to call GetBaseObject, which is good. BaseObject.GetBaseObject will return null and base objects are always stable. Stable.
;A valid formid represents GetFormIDString was able to retrieve a FormID. Stable.
;"FF000800" represents GetFormIDString was unable to retrieve a FormID (the one exception is for the first reference dropped per timeline). Unstable.
