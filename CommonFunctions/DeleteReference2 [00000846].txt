scn DeleteReference2

;Only disabled references can be deleted by DeleteReference.
;This function first disables the reference, then waits 2 frames before DeleteReference.
;If the reference form is not valid (likely because it isn't loaded), it is shunted to RAWSTREAMDeathRowRefs.
;The references of RAWSTREAMDeathRowRefs are checked for validity on each CellChanged. If they are valid, they are deleted. If a reference has been in RAWSTREAMDeathRowRefs for longer than the CellRespawn period, it is forgotten.
